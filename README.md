## About
DocSplit is a software designed to split textbook PDFs into seperate PDFs by chapter. It was created in order to be able to create Flashcards and Practice Tests more easily using AI on [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/), as only 50,000 words can be input at a time.

## Features
- Automatic chapter detection based on contents page.
- Exports chapter PDFs as a zip file

## Installation and Running
The software can currently be run at [blazeandflame.pythonanywhere.com](https://blazeandflame.pythonanywhere.com/). There are plans for a desktop software in the future.


## Usage
<!-- **Compulsory**: Provide basic examples of how to use the software. Include screenshots or code snippets if helpful. -->
